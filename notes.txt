Problem: the rect doesn't stick to the ceiling which (because its a pillar ofc)

i want to make the pillar stick to the ceiling.

solution one:
    instead of changing the y axis, change the height of the pillar where you only make the pillar always summon at y = 0 (the ceiling) then just change the gap between the two rects
    problem is that i dont know how to make the pillar seem like its not going too deep


problem:
    each time the first rect changes its height randomly the second rect also changes but with the same size, what i want to do is that I want the second rect to adjust
    depending on the size of the first rect

    lets say there's a maximum of 500 height where the first rect has the height of 300 and the second rect is 100 so there's an extra gap which is 100 pixels
    and now 


    height gap limit

    height : the object's height
    gap : the object's gap inbetween the two objects
    limit : how big the area where the two objects reside

    limit is equal to 800
    gap is 200
    height is 200

    x = limit - gap - height
